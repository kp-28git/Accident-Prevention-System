# Accident Detection and Reporting System

## Overview
This project implements an **Accident Detection and Reporting System** using the **ESP32**, and multiple sensors. It detects potential accidents by monitoring accelerometer data and alcohol sensor values, reports the location, and logs data to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring.

## Features
- **Accident Detection**: Uses accelerometer data to detect sudden impacts or abnormal movements.
- **Alcohol Detection**: Monitors alcohol levels using an alcohol sensor.
- **Location Tracking**: Retrieves GPS coordinates from a GPS module.
- **ThingSpeak Logging**: Logs data, including sensor readings and GPS coordinates, to ThingSpeak for analysis.
